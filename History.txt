=== 1.1.1 2012-09-11

* removed the executables

=== 1.1.0 2012-09-06

* Added the method ip to the class Vm
* Added the interractive mode

=== 1.0.0 2012-08-24

* remove the function Vm.backup!
It was creating crashes... Thanks to the stability of VirtualBox..
Now the strategy is to shutdown all the VMs and then export each one

* add Vm.stop!
Will ssh to each VMs (need to have your hosts file configured accordingly) and launch shutdown command

* changed VmLister.backup!
To avoid the VirtualBox crashes mentionned above.

=== 0.0.1 2012-08-16

 * 1 bug fix :

  * VmLister.manage was calling an old Vm method (act) which didn't exist anymore.
